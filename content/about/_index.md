My backgroup is in physical oceanography (Msc at [U.B.O.](univ-brest.fr)) and I have been
working on numerical models of the ocean ever since. My areas of interest are Air/Sea fluxes
since [DRAKKAR](drakkar-ocean.eu), ocean Biogeochemistry since [Rutgers](esm.rutgers.edu) as
well as high performance computing, big data and software development.
I have worked with [NEMO](nemo-ocean.eu), [ROMS](myroms.org),
[MITgcm](mitgcm.org) and [MOM6](www.gfdl.noaa.gov/mom-ocean-model) for coarse to high resolution,
global or regional applications.
